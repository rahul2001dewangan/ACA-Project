# Project 1

## Memory Hierarchy Design and Performance Analysis

This project explores how cache size, associativity, pipeline width, TLB entries, and branch prediction affect the performance of a superscalar processor using the SimpleScalar simulator.
A total of 149 configurations were tested using the standard test-fmath benchmark to identify bottlenecks, optimal design points, and diminishing returns across different architectural parameters.



# Project 2

## RRIP Cache Replacement Policy – SimpleScalar

This project adds RRIP (Re-Reference Interval Prediction) as a new cache replacement policy in the SimpleScalar (sim-outorder) simulator and compares it with LRU.
